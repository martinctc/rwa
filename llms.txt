Perform a Relative Weights Analysis in R

### Background

**Relative Weights Analysis (RWA)** is a method of calculating relative
importance of predictor variables in contributing to an outcome
variable. The method implemented by this function is based on Tonidandel
and LeBreton (2015), but the origin of this specific approach can be
traced back to Johnson (2000), *A Heuristic Method for Estimating the
Relative Weight of Predictor Variables in Multiple Regression*. Broadly
speaking, RWA belongs to a family of techiques under the broad umbrella
‘Relative Importance Analysis’, where other members include the ‘Shapley
method’ and ‘dominance analysis’. This is often referred to as ‘Key
Drivers Analysis’ within market research.

This package is built around the main function
[`rwa()`](https://martinctc.github.io/rwa/reference/rwa.md), which takes
in a data frame as an argument and allows you to specify the names of
the input variables and the outcome variable as arguments.

The [`rwa()`](https://martinctc.github.io/rwa/reference/rwa.md) function
in this package is compatible with dplyr / tidyverse style of piping
operations to enable cleaner and more readable code.

### Installation

You can install the stable CRAN version of **rwa** with:

``` r
install.packages("rwa")
```

Alternatively, you can install the latest development version from
GitHub with:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("martinctc/rwa")
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Method / Technical details

RWA decomposes the total variance predicted in a regression model (R2)
into weights that accurately reﬂect the proportional contribution of the
various predictor variables.

RWA is a useful technique to calculate the relative importance of
predictors (independent variables) when independent variables are
correlated to each other. It is an alternative to multiple regression
technique and it addresses the *multicollinearity* problem, and also
helps to calculate the importance rank of variables. It helps to answer
“which variable is the most important and rank variables based on their
contribution to R-Square”.

See
<https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10869-014-9351-z.pdf>.

### Multicollinearity

When independent variables are correlated, it is difficult to determine
the correct prediction power of each variable. Hence, it is difficult to
rank them as we are unable to estimate coefficients correctly.
Statistically, multicollinearity can increase the standard error of the
coefficient estimates and make the estimates very sensitive to minor
changes in the model. It means the coefficients are biased and difficult
to interpret.

### Signs

Key Drivers Analysis methods do not conventionally include a score sign,
which can make it difficult to interpret whether a variable is
*positively* or *negatively* driving the outcome. The `applysigns`
argument in
[`rwa::rwa()`](https://martinctc.github.io/rwa/reference/rwa.md), when
set to `TRUE`, allows the application of positive or negative signs to
the driver scores to match the signs of the corresponding linear
regression coefficients from the model. This feature mimics the solution
used in the [Q research
software](https://wiki.q-researchsoftware.com/wiki/Driver_(Importance)_Analysis).
The resulting column is labelled `Sign.Rescaled.RelWeight` to
distinguish from the unsigned column.

### Estimating the statistical significance of relative weights

As Tonidandel et al. (2009) noted, there is no default procedure for
determining the statistical significance of individual relative weights:

> The difficulty in determining the statistical significance of relative
> weights stems from the fact that the exact (or small sample) sampling
> distribution of relative weights is unknown.

The paper itself suggests a Monte Carlo method for estimating the
statistical significance, but this is currently not available or
provided in the package, but the plan is to implement this in the near
future.

### Basic example

You can pass the raw data directly into
[`rwa()`](https://martinctc.github.io/rwa/reference/rwa.md), without
having to first compute a correlation matrix. The below example is with
`mtcars`.

Code:

``` r
library(rwa)
library(tidyverse)

mtcars %>%
  rwa(outcome = "mpg",
      predictors = c("cyl", "disp", "hp", "gear"),
      applysigns = TRUE)
```

Results:

``` r
$predictors
[1] "cyl"  "disp" "hp"   "gear"

$rsquare
[1] 0.7791896

$result
  Variables Raw.RelWeight Rescaled.RelWeight Sign Sign.Rescaled.RelWeight
1       cyl     0.2284797           29.32274    -               -29.32274
2      disp     0.2221469           28.50999    -               -28.50999
3        hp     0.2321744           29.79691    -               -29.79691
4      gear     0.0963886           12.37037    +                12.37037

$n
[1] 32      
```

### Latest Status

The main [`rwa()`](https://martinctc.github.io/rwa/reference/rwa.md)
function is ready-to-use and now includes bootstrap confidence intervals
for determining the statistical significance of relative weights. The
package includes comprehensive documentation through vignettes and is
designed to integrate seamlessly with tidyverse workflows.
