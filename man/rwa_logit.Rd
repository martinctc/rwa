\title{Create a Relative Weights Analysis with logistic regression}
\usage{
rwa_logit(df, outcome, predictors, applysigns = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame or tibble to be passed through.}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable, to be specified as a string or bare input.
Must be a numeric variable.}

\item{predictors}{Predictor variable(s), to be specified as a vector of
string(s) or bare input(s). All variables must be numeric.}

\item{applysigns}{Logical value specifying whether to show an estimate that
applies the sign. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\code{rwa_logit()} returns a list of outputs, as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{predictors}: character vector of names of the predictor variables used.
\item \code{result}: the final output of the importance metrics.
\itemize{
\item The \code{Rescaled.RelWeight} column sums up to 1.
\item The \code{Sign} column indicates whether a predictor is positively or negatively associated with the outcome.
}
\item \code{n}: indicates the number of observations used in the analysis.
\item \code{lambda}: pseudo R-squared value for the logistic regression model.
}
}
\description{
This function creates a Relative Weights Analysis (RWA) and
returns a list of outputs. RWA provides a heuristic method for estimating
the relative weight of predictor variables in multiple regression, which
involves creating a multiple regression with on a set of transformed
predictors which are orthogonal to each other but maximally related to the
original set of predictors. \code{rwa()} is optimised for dplyr pipes and shows
positive / negative signs for weights.

\examples{
# Create a binary outcome variable
mtcars_binary <- mtcars
mtcars_binary$high_mpg <- ifelse(mtcars$mpg > median(mtcars$mpg), 1, 0)

# Basic logistic RWA
result <- rwa_logit(
  df = mtcars_binary,
  outcome = "high_mpg",
  predictors = c("cyl", "disp", "hp", "wt")
)

# View the relative importance results
result$result

# With sign information
result_signed <- rwa_logit(
  df = mtcars_binary,
  outcome = "high_mpg",
  predictors = c("cyl", "disp", "hp", "wt"),
  applysigns = TRUE
)
result_signed$result
