\title{Create a Relative Weights Analysis with logistic regression}
\usage{
rwa_logit(df, outcome, predictors, applysigns = FALSE, plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame or tibble to be passed through.}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable, to be specified as a string or bare input. Must be a numeric variable.}

\item{predictors}{Predictor variable(s), to be specified as a vector of string(s) or bare input(s). All variables must be numeric.}

\item{applysigns}{Logical value specifying whether to show an estimate that applies the sign. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{plot}{Logical value specifying whether to plot the rescaled importance metrics.}
}
\description{
This function creates a Relative Weights Analysis (RWA) and returns a list of outputs.
RWA provides a heuristic method for estimating the relative weight of predictor variables in multiple regression, which involves
creating a multiple regression with on a set of transformed predictors which are orthogonal to each other but
maximally related to the original set of predictors.
\code{rwa()} is optimised for dplyr pipes and shows positive / negative signs for weights.
