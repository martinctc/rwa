\title{Create a Relative Weight Analysis (RWA)}
\usage{
rwa(df, outcome, predictors, applysigns = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame or tibble to be passed through.}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable, to be specified as a string or bare input. Must be a numeric variable.}

\item{predictors}{Predictor variable(s), to be specified as a vector of string(s) or bare input(s). All variables must be numeric.}

\item{applysigns}{A logical vector specifying whether to show an estimate that applies the sign. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\code{rwa()} returns a list of outputs, as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{predictors}: character vector of names of the predictor variables used.
\item \code{rsquare}: the rsquare value of the regression model.
\item \code{result}: the final output of the importance metrics.
\itemize{
\item The \code{Rescaled.RelWeight} column sums up to 100.
\item The \code{Sign} column indicates whether a predictor is positively or negatively correlated with the outcome.
}
\item \code{n}: indicates the number of observations used in the analysis.
}
}
\description{
This function creates a Relative Weight Analysis (RWA) and returns a list of outputs.
RWA involves creating a linear regression model based on a set of transformed predictors, which are orthogonal to each other but
maximally proximate to the original set of predictors.
\code{rwa()} is optimised for dplyr pipes and shows positive / negative signs for weights.

library(ggplot2)
rwa(diamonds,"price",c("depth","carat"))
