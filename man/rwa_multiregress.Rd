\title{Create a Relative Weights Analysis (RWA)}
\usage{
rwa_multiregress(df, outcome, predictors, applysigns = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame or tibble to be passed through.}

\item{outcome}{Outcome variable, to be specified as a string or bare input. Must be a numeric variable.}

\item{predictors}{Predictor variable(s), to be specified as a vector of string(s) or bare input(s). All variables must be numeric.}

\item{applysigns}{Logical value specifying whether to show an estimate that applies the sign. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
\code{rwa_multiregress()} returns a list of outputs, as follows:
\itemize{
\item \code{predictors}: character vector of names of the predictor variables used.
\item \code{rsquare}: the rsquare value of the regression model.
\item \code{result}: the final output of the importance metrics.
\itemize{
\item The \code{Rescaled.RelWeight} column sums up to 100.
\item The \code{Sign} column indicates whether a predictor is positively or negatively correlated with the outcome.
}
\item \code{n}: indicates the number of observations used in the analysis.
\item \code{lambda}:
\item \code{RXX}: Correlation matrix of all the predictor variables against each other.
\item \code{RXY}: Correlation values of the predictor variables against the outcome variable.
}
}
\description{
This function creates a Relative Weights Analysis (RWA) and returns a list of outputs.
RWA provides a heuristic method for estimating the relative weight of predictor variables in multiple regression, which involves
creating a multiple regression with on a set of transformed predictors which are orthogonal to each other but
maximally related to the original set of predictors.
\code{rwa()} is optimised for dplyr pipes and shows positive / negative signs for weights.
}
\details{
\code{rwa()} produces raw relative weight values (epsilons) as well as rescaled weights (scaled as a percentage of predictable variance)
for every predictor in the model.
Signs are added to the weights when the \code{applysigns} argument is set to \code{TRUE}.
See https://relativeimportance.davidson.edu/multipleregression.html for the original implementation that inspired this package.
