Title: Perform a Relative Weights Analysis
Version: 0.0.1
Author: Martin Chan <martinchan53@gmail.com>

Description: Perform a Relative Weights Analysis (RWA) as per the method described 
    in Tonidandel & LeBreton (2015), and can be traced back to Johnson (2000). In essence, RWA decomposes
    the total variance predicted in a regression model into weights that accurately reflect the proportional 
    contribution of the predictor variables, which addresses the issue of multi-collinearity.
