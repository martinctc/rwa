Description: Perform a Relative Weights Analysis (RWA) (a.k.a. Key Drivers Analysis) as per the method described 
    in Tonidandel & LeBreton (2015) <DOI:10.1007/s10869-014-9351-z>, with its original roots in Johnson (2000) <DOI:10.1207/S15327906MBR3501_1>. In essence, RWA decomposes
    the total variance predicted in a regression model into weights that accurately reflect the proportional 
    contribution of the predictor variables, which addresses the issue of multi-collinearity. In typical scenarios,
    RWA returns similar results to Shapley regression, but with a significant advantage on computational performance.
