Description: Perform a Relative Weight Analysis (RWA) as per the method specified 
    in Tonidandel & LeBreton. In essence, RWA decomposes the total variance predicted
    in a regression model into weights that accurately reflect the proportional contribution
    of the predictor variables, which addresses the issue of multi-collinearity.
